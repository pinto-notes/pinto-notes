// The lifecycle emails, in words and in HTML. Each is a note from Emil, drawn the way the site draws
// notes (the 404 page, the template pages): a paper-cut picture on top for warmth, then an Amber
// Notes window with the words, and inside it, where one explains something, a real capture of the
// app for proof (the grocery note with its Undo bar, the apps, the templates, a shared note).
//
// Built for real mail apps (docs/Technical/lifecycle-emails.md has the client notes):
// - tables and inline styles; no flex, grid, background images, web fonts or SVG;
// - shapes that must show everywhere (checkboxes) are table cells, so Outlook for Windows draws
//   them as squares instead of dropping them;
// - three <style> blocks, so a client that drops one (Gmail drops a block it doesn't like) keeps
//   the others: phone spacing, dark mode for Apple Mail and Outlook apps, Outlook.com's dark mode;
// - no pure white or black, so Gmail's forced dark mode (it inverts colours, never images) stays soft;
// - a plain-text twin, and every HTML file far under Gmail's 102 KB clipping limit.
//
// The copy follows the house rules: Emil's voice, short, no em dashes, no invented features, and never
// a person's own data quoted back (no note counts). Nothing here knows what a person's notes say.
