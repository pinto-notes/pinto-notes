// Connecting an AI to Amber Notes.
//
// ChatGPT and Claude sign in with OAuth: they send the person's browser to the MCP server's
// /authorize, which opens ambernotes.app/connect?request=<id>. That page hands over to the app,
// by https://ambernotes.app/open/connect?request=<id> or ambernotes://connect?request=<id>. The
// app (already signed in) shows who's asking, the person allows read-only or read and edit with
// Face ID or Touch ID, and the app sends the browser on to the AI with the result.
//
// The notes are end-to-end encrypted, so approving hands the AI a copy of the account's key: the
// app makes the authorization code itself and sends the server only its hash and the key wrapped
// under it. The server's answer is the AI's return address without a code; the app adds it.
// Claude Code and Codex get a pane_ token made here the same way, used only in a request header.
