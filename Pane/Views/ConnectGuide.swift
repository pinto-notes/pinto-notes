// Amber Notes is listed in Claude's connector directory (since 2 October 2026), so for Claude one
// button opens the listing and the person chooses Connect to Claude. Claude's install link for its
// Add custom connector dialog, with the name and address filled in, stays as the fallback for
// older Claude apps. ChatGPT has no such link: the button copies the address and opens ChatGPT's
// Plugins page. Both are added on the web or desktop, once; after that they work in the phone
// apps too. claude.ai doesn't hand /directory links to its iPhone app, so iPhone sends the link
// to the computer, as before. The steps stay
// in view (on a Mac, in a small window that floats over the browser), and the guide watches
// for the sign-in itself and says when it worked, with a first thing to ask.
